# Deep_learning
This repository is for the exam project in course 02456, Deep Learning at DTU. 
In the folders ResNet18 and ResNet50 is the results for testing the ResNets 
In the folder NASNet our results for running the Neural architecture search on our ResNet. 

A fully runable .ipynb file can be found in the folder NASNet. It is the one called ''. This notebook contains a standard neural architecture search of the resnet. It takes approx 4-5 hours to run on a cpuv100 architecture type via HPC. It prints results while running.
